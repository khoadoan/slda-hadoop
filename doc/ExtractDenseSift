Here is how to extract dense sift feature from a single image.

1) Create a new object of class ExtractDenseSiftFromImage and specify the file path and the step size in the constructor parameter.
2) From the object, call getExtractedFeatures() method and it will return a 2D array of size [number of patches] * [number of feature].

Example:

float[][] extractedSiftFeatures = 
            new ExtractDenseSiftFromImage(filePath, 16).getExtractedFeatures();
