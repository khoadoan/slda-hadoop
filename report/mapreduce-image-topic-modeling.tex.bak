\begin{abstract}
Large scale computer vision is recently being popular due to the emerging of large scale imagery data and in need of more generally trained visual models.
Recent advances in feature extraction provide a feasible and succinct way to represent image regions. However, most of these features are computationally heavy to extract. Since there is no explicit methods to essentially speed up feature extraction, parallelization become the most comfortable strategy for this task.
Due to the inherent high dimensionality of visual data, extracted features can be very noisy and thus not representative for images. Feature quantization is introduced to group similar features into the same low level semantics. K-means clustering is one of the usual choices for quantization while it may suffer from either time or space problems in ordinary environment. Latent Dirichlet Allocation is one of the techniques to discover higher level topic semantics for the context, which was popular in natural language processing. In this project, we unearth the potential of adapting computer vision tasks such as low level feature extraction and higher level image understanding into the MapReduce framework for large scale image dataset. We adopt the MapReduce LDA (Mr.LDA) to find topics across the images and discuss its possible extensions with respect to the image domain.

\section{Introduction}
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section \ref{sec:overview} briefly introduces the system structure of this project.
Mapreduce framework for visual feature extraction is discussed in section \ref{sec:feature}.
Details of Mr.LDA is introduced in section \ref{sec:mrlda}. In section \ref{sec:impl}, a few implementation details are
discussed. Section \ref{sec:exp} shows the evaluation methods and experimental results for this project. Discussion on
possible extensions from LDA to Spatial LDA is presented in section \ref{sec:slda}. Finally, the paper concludes in section \ref{sec:con}.

\section{System Overview}\label{sec:overview}

\section{Feature Extraction}\label{sec:feature}
\subsection{Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)}
In this work, the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) \cite{sift} is adopted to describe local regions across the images. Generally, a SIFT descriptor represent a region bounded by a rectangular box centered at $(x_c,y_c)$. The bounding box is uniformly divided into $K\times K$ parts. The gradients are computed in these sub-regions and the gradient magnitudes in $N_b$ (the number of bins) discretized orientations  are computed. A histogram is then constructed to represent the distribution of the gradient magnitudes. Therefore, for each region, the SIFT descriptor is a $K^2N_b$ dimensional histogram vector.

One of the advantages of SIFT descriptors is its invariance to image rotation and translation, which makes this feature very popular among the computer vision community. We base our project on the MPI-CBG JavaSIFT library\cite{mpicbg}.
\subsection{Dense Sampling SIFT}
In order to apply SIFT features to represent the whole image for the task of image labeling, each of the pixels ideally should be described.

\section{Implementation Remarks}\label{sec:impl}

\section{Experimental Evaluation}\label{sec:exp}
\subsection{Dataset}
\subsubsection{MSRC Image Labeling Dataset}
The MSRC image labeling dataset (version 1) \cite{msrc} contains 240 images and 9 object classes in total. 
Each of the images is pixel-wise labelled.
\subsubsection{Eastern Coast Satellite Image Dataset}
We also collect satellite images using Google Maps APIs along the eastern coast in the United States. Each of the image is of 8-bit colormap PNG format and contains $402\times415$ pixels. Due to the capacity of our cluster, we pick 10,000 images amongst the dataset for the experiments.

\subsection{Qualitative Evaluation}
Images with labels in different colors are recovered from the output of LDA to show qualitatively which parts belong to the same semantics.
\subsection{Quantitative Evaluation}
Traditional computer vision dataset has ground-truth for evaluation. For the MSRC image labeling data, each image is corresponded to a groundtruth image in which the whole image is divided into several components. Each component is annotated using a unique RGB color. In our output, each pixel is assigned to a type of semantics. Since our approach is completely unsupervised, the truth meaning of each semantic is not understandable. One possible way to evaluate the performance is to enumerate every possible correspondence between the two set of semantics. Apparently this strategy only works when the number of topics is small enough. It becomes difficult to construct a one-one correspondence between our labels and the groundtruth labels. In fact, how to accurately evaluate the performance of image segmentation tasks is still an open problem.

In this project, we propose to evaluate the results for each of the topics separately. For each semantic in the groundtruth, a binary image can be constructed, regions with value 1 are those containing such semantic and otherwise not. For the output of the resulted topics, the topic that has the most number of occurrences in the semantic regions are chosen as a correspondence. The precision and recall are then computed according to that topic.
\begin{align}
\text{precision}&=\frac{\text{\#TruePositive}}{\text{\#TruePositive+\#FalsePositive}}\\
\text{recall}&=\frac{\text{\#TruePositive}}{\text{\#TruePositive+\#FalseNegative}}
\end{align}
