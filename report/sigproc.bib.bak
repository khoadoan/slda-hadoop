  abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant
	features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching
	between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant
	to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching
	across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in {3D} viewpoint,
	addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly
	distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly
	matched with high probability against a large database of features
	from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using
	these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by
	matching individual features to a database of features from known
	objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough
	transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and
	finally performing verification through least-squares solution for
	consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly
	identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near
	real-time performance.},

  abstract = {Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}) is a popular topic modeling technique
	for exploring document collections. Because of the increasing prevalence
	of large datasets, there is a need to improve the scalability of
	inference for {LDA}. In this paper, we introduce a novel and flexible
	large scale topic modeling package in {MapReduce} (Mr. {LDA}). As
	opposed to other techniques which use Gibbs sampling, our proposed
	framework uses variational inference, which easily fits into a distributed
	environment. More importantly, this variational implementation, unlike
	highly tuned and specialized implementations based on Gibbs sampling,
	is easily extensible. We demonstrate two extensions of the models
	possible with this scalable framework: informed priors to guide topic
	discovery and extracting topics from a multilingual corpus. We compare
	the scalability of Mr. {LDA} against Mahout, an existing large scale
	topic modeling package. Mr. {LDA} out-performs Mahout both in execution
	speed and held-out likelihood.},
